__AutoPkgr is a free macOS app that makes it easy to configure and run [AutoPkg](https://autopkg.github.io/autopkg/).__

AutoPkg is an awesomely powerful tool for automating macOS software packaging and distribution, but it requires its users to be comfortable with command line tools and methods. If you're not yet comfortable with the command line, or if you just want to get AutoPkg set up and scheduled quickly and reliably, AutoPkgr is for you.

To get started, download the [latest release](https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr/releases/latest). If you need help, we recommend that you check out the [AutoPkgr Wiki](https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr/wiki)!
